# openfilter-pipelines-controller

A Kubernetes operator built with Kubebuilder v4 that manages and reconciles Openfilter Pipeline custom resources in the `filter.plainsight.ai` API group.

## Description

This operator provides a Kubernetes-native way to define and manage data processing Openfilter Pipelines through the `Pipeline` custom resource definition (CRD). It runs within a Kubernetes cluster and automatically reconciles Pipeline resources, implementing the declarative configuration model for defining, deploying, and managing filter-based data pipelines. The operator is built with controller-runtime and handles all aspects of Pipeline lifecycle management including creation, updates, status tracking, and deletion.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- go version v1.24.0+
- docker version 17.03+.
- kubectl version v1.11.3+.
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster.

### To Deploy on the cluster
**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/openfilter-pipelines-controller:tag
```

**NOTE:** This image ought to be published in the personal registry you specified.
And it is required to have access to pull the image from the working environment.
Make sure you have the proper permission to the registry if the above commands don’t work.

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

```sh
make install
```

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/openfilter-pipelines-controller:tag
```

> **NOTE**: If you encounter RBAC errors, you may need to grant yourself cluster-admin
privileges or be logged in as admin.

**Create instances of your solution**
You can apply the samples (examples) from the config/sample:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

>**NOTE**: Ensure that the samples has default values to test it out.

### To Uninstall
**Delete the instances (CRs) from the cluster:**

```sh
kubectl delete -k config/samples/
```

**Delete the APIs(CRDs) from the cluster:**

```sh
make uninstall
```

**UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:**

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Project Distribution

Following the options to release and provide this solution to the users.

### By providing a bundle with all YAML files

1. Build the installer for the image built and published in the registry:

```sh
make build-installer IMG=<some-registry>/openfilter-pipelines-controller:tag
```

**NOTE:** The makefile target mentioned above generates an 'install.yaml'
file in the dist directory. This file contains all the resources built
with Kustomize, which are necessary to install this project without its
dependencies.

2. Using the installer

Users can just run 'kubectl apply -f <URL for YAML BUNDLE>' to install
the project, i.e.:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<org>/openfilter-pipelines-controller/<tag or branch>/dist/install.yaml
```

### Using the Helm Chart

The Helm chart lives in this repository under `deployment/openfilter-pipelines-controller`. Clone the repo and install from the local chart:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/PlainsightAI/openfilter-pipelines-controller
cd openfilter-pipelines-controller

helm install openfilter-pipelines-controller deployment/openfilter-pipelines-controller \
  --namespace pipelines-system \
  --create-namespace
```

Install with the bundled Valkey subchart enabled (optional):

```sh
helm install openfilter-pipelines-controller deployment/openfilter-pipelines-controller \
  --namespace pipelines-system \
  --create-namespace \
  --set valkey.enabled=true
```

To upgrade an existing installation:

```sh
helm upgrade openfilter-pipelines-controller deployment/openfilter-pipelines-controller \
  --namespace pipelines-system
```

For more configuration options, see the [chart values](deployment/openfilter-pipelines-controller/values.yaml) and the [chart README](deployment/openfilter-pipelines-controller/README.md).
